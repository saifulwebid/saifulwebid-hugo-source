> Who's to say we learn our most valuable skills in school? Teach someone a skill you know best. I'd be happy to teach someone how to use the internet for research effectively and how to assess reliability of data and having the discernment to sniff for false information. It's probably an ordinary skill to some of you but it would be useful for someone out there. It is very useful for Indonesia as the level of data quality released by survey centers and some public bodies are really quite apalling.
